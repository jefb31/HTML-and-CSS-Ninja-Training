          <h1>Geography of Ethiopia</h1>

            At 1,126,829 square kilometres (435,071 sq mi),[109] Ethiopia is the
            world's 27th-largest country, comparable in size to Bolivia. It lies
            between latitudes 3° and 15°N, and longitudes 33° and 48°E. <span style="display: block; color: red; font-weight: bold"> The major
            portion of Ethiopia lies on the Horn of Africa,</span>which is the easternmost
            part of the African landmass. Bordering Ethiopia are Sudan and South
            Sudan to the west, Djibouti and Eritrea to the north, Somalia to the
            east and Kenya to the south. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex
            of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the Great Rift Valley,
            which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by
            lowlands, steppes, or semi-desert.The great diversity of terrain
            determines wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation, and settlement patterns.</p>

          <h1>Climate</h1>
          <p><img src="http://www.ethiopicture.com/app/webroot/photos/large/858-gbpj3jwm311c9f2ycb5r.jpg" width="400px" height="200px" id="img2">
            The predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic
            -induced variation. The Ethiopian Highlands cover most of the country
            and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other
            regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major
            cities are located at elevations of around 2,000–2,500 m (6,562–8,202 ft)
            above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum.
            The modern capital Addis Ababa is situated on the foothills of Mount
            Entoto, at an elevation of around 2,400 m (7,874 ft). It experiences
            a mild climate year round. With fairly uniform year round temperatures,
            the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall, with a dry season
            from October–February, a light rainy season from March–May, and a heavy
            rainy season from June–September. The average annual rainfall is around 1,200 mm (47.2 in).</p>

      <div id="lalibela">Lalibela was originally known as Roha during the reign of
        St. Gebre Mesqel Lalibela, and was later named after him - Lalibela.
        St. Gebre was a member of the Zagwe Dynasty who ruled Ethiopia for around
        40 years in the late 12th century. The name “Lalibela“ was given to him
        because he was surrounded by a swarm of bees at birth; his mother took
        this a sign of his future reign of Ethiopia. The name “Lalibela“ means
        “the bees recognise his sovereignty“ (that's a lot to fit in one word!)
        in Old Agaw, a Cushitic language no longer spoken in Ethiopia. Lalibela
        was the capital of Ethiopia until the 13th century - the current capital
        is Addis Ababa.</div>

        <p>The section element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context, is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. Examples of sections would be chapters, the various tabbed pages in a tabbed dialog box, or the numbered sections of a thesis. A Web site's home page could be split into sections for an introduction, news items, and contact information.</p>
