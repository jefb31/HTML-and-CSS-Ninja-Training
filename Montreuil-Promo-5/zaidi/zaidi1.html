        The society and culture of Pakistan <span style="display: block; color:blue">(Urdu: ثقافتِ پاکستان‎ S̱aqāfat-e Pākistān) </span> comprises numerous ethnic groups: the Punjabis, Kashmiris, Sindhis in east, Muhajirs, Makrani in the south; Baloch, Hazaras and Pashtun
        in the west; and the ancient Dardic, Wakhi, Baltistani and Burusho communities in the north. The culture of these Pakistani ethnic groups have been greatly influenced by many of its neighbors, such as the other South Asians, Turkic peoples as
        well as the peoples of Central Asia and the Middle East. The origins of the current Pakistani culture can be traced back to the Indus Valley civilization, which was contemporaneous with the ancient Egyptian and Sumerian civilizations, around 5500
        years ago. The region has formed a distinct unit within the main geographical complex of South Asia, the Middle East and Central Asia from the earliest times, and is analogous to the position of Afghanistan.[1] There are differences among the
        ethnic groups in cultural aspects such as dress, food, and religion, especially where pre-Islamic customs differ from Islamic practices. Their cultural origins also reveal influences from far afield, including China, India and Afghanistan. Pakistan
        was the first region of South Asia to be fully impacted by Islam and has thus developed a distinct Islamic identity, historically different from areas further east.[1]

        The culture of Brazil is primarily Western, but presents a very diverse nature showing that an ethnic and cultural mixing occurred in the colonial period involving mostly Indigenous peoples of the coastal and most accessible riverine areas, Portuguese
        people and African peoples. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, together with further waves of Portuguese colonization, Italians, Spaniards, Germans, Levantine Arabs, Nipponics, Poles, Helvetians and Ukrainians settled in Brazil, playing
        an important role in its culture as it started to shape a multicultural and multiethnic society.[1] As consequence of three centuries of colonization by the Portuguese empire, the core of Brazilian culture is derived from the culture of Portugal.
        The numerous Portuguese inheritances include the language, the predominant religion and the colonial architectural styles.[2]<span style="color:blue"> These aspects, however,</span> were influenced by African and Indigenous American traditions,
        as well as those from other Western European countries.[3] Some aspects of Brazilian culture are contributions of Italian, German and other European immigrants.[4] Amerindian people and Africans played a large role in the formation of Brazilian
        language, cuisine, music, dance and religion.[4][5] This diverse cultural background has helped boast many celebrations and festivals that have become known around the world, such as the Brazilian Carnival and the Bumba Meu Boi. The colourful
        culture creates an environment that makes Brazil a popular destination for many tourists each year, around over 1 million.[6]
